REMAINDER FUNCTION:
(remainder x y) ? integer
  x : integer
  y : integer
Determines the remainder of dividing the first by the second integer (exact or inexact).
> (remainder 9 2)
1
> (remainder 3 4)
3

MODULO FUNCTION:
(modulo n m) ? integer?
  n : integer?
  m : integer?
Returns q with the same sign as m where
(abs q) is between 0 (inclusive) and (abs m) (exclusive), and

the difference between q and (- n (* m (quotient n m))) is a multiple of m.

If m is exact 0, the exn:fail:contract:divide-by-zero exception is raised.

Examples:
> (modulo 10 3)
1
> (modulo -10.0 3)
2.0
> (modulo 10.0 -3)
-2.0
> (modulo -10 -3)
-1
